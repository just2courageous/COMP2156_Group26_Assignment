SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
The SDLC is a structured process used to build software in a reliable way. It helps teams plan, create, test, and maintain software.

Common SDLC phases include:

Requirements: understand what the software must do

Design: plan the structure and how the system will work

Development: write the code and build the features

Testing: verify the software works and fix defects

Deployment: release the software to users

Maintenance: monitor, support, and improve the software over time

DevOps supports the SDLC by automating testing and deployment, improving feedback speed, and helping teams deliver changes more frequently with fewer errors.
