SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is the process used to build and maintain software in a structured way.

Common SDLC phases:
1. Planning
2. Requirements Analysis
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance

SDLC helps teams:
- organize work
- reduce errors
- improve software quality
- manage project timelines

DevOps supports SDLC by improving collaboration, automation, and faster delivery during development, testing, and deployment.

Additional Notes:
- SDLC provides a structured approach to software development.
- DevOps improves SDLC by adding automation and continuous integration.

Why learning SDLC is important:
- It helps developers understand the full software process.
- It improves planning and communication within teams.
- It ensures better quality control before deployment.
