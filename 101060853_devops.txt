DevOps
DevOps is a set of practices that helps development and operations teams work together to deliver software faster and more reliably. It focuses on automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

Key DevOps ideas include version control, automated builds, automated testing, and automated deployments. A typical DevOps workflow uses Git and GitHub for source control, a CI tool to run tests on every push, and a CD process to release changes safely.

In this course, I am practicing DevOps by working in a shared GitHub repository, creating a personal branch, making meaningful commits, and using pull requests to merge work into the main branch.

DevOps Tools I’m learning
Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration, Linux command line for working on servers, and CI pipelines to automatically run checks on every push and pull request.

CI Pipeline Steps
A typical CI pipeline runs automatically when code is pushed. It can install dependencies, run tests, run lint checks, and show pass or fail results in the repository. This helps catch errors early before merging into the main branch.

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery)
CI runs automated checks (like linting/tests) on every push or pull request. CD automates delivery or deployment after CI passes. This reduces human error and makes releases faster and safer.

CI/CD in this repo
CI (Continuous Integration) runs automated checks (like confirming required files exist) when code is pushed or a pull request is opened.
CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) is the next stage where changes can be released after CI passes (not fully implemented here, but CI is set up with GitHub Actions).
