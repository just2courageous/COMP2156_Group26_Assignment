DevOps
DevOps is a set of practices that helps development and operations teams work together to deliver software faster and more reliably. It focuses on automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

Key DevOps ideas include version control, automated builds, automated testing, and automated deployments. A typical DevOps workflow uses Git and GitHub for source control, a CI tool to run tests on every push, and a CD process to release changes safely.

In this course, I am practicing DevOps by working in a shared GitHub repository, creating a personal branch, making meaningful commits, and using pull requests to merge work into the main branch.

DevOps Tools I’m learning
Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration, Linux command line for working on servers, and CI pipelines to automatically run checks on every push and pull request.
