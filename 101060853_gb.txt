George Brown College (GBC)
My program is focused on building practical skills for the IT industry. I work with real tools used in professional environments, including Git and GitHub for version control, Linux command line basics, and continuous integration and delivery concepts.

In COMP2156, I am learning DevOps practices such as branching strategies, pull requests, collaboration workflows, and CI pipelines. I am also improving communication skills needed for team based software development, including documenting work clearly and resolving merge conflicts properly.

My Git Collaboration Practice
In this group assignment, I created my own branch, added my required files, and opened a pull request to merge into main. I am learning how to write clear commit messages, keep changes small, and collaborate safely using branches and reviews.

Teamwork and Collaboration
In this group assignment, I practiced teamwork by working on my own branch, committing changes locally, and using a pull request to merge my work into the main branch. This helped me follow a real collaborative workflow.
