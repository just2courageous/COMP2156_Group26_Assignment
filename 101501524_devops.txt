DevOps (Development and Operations) is a way of working that improves collaboration between developers and operations teams.

DevOps focuses on:
-faster delivery
-automation
-teamwork
-continuous improvement

Important DevOps concepts:
- CI (Continuous Integration): frequently merging code changes into a shared repository
- CD (Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment): automatically preparing or releasing code changes
- Version Control: tracking code changes using Git
- Pull Request (PR): reviewing and merging changes safely

In this assignment, we use GitHub branches, commits, and pull requests as part of a DevOps workflow.
GitHub Actions is used for CI checks in the repository.

Notes:
- Added short summary and key DevOps concepts for the assignment.

Example of DevOps in practice:
- A developer pushes code to GitHub.
- CI automatically runs tests.
- If tests pass, the code is ready to be merged.
- This reduces manual work and human errors.
