Important DevOps concepts:
- CI (Continuous Integration): frequently merging code changes into a shared repository
- CD (Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment): automatically preparing or releasing code changes
- Version Control: tracking code changes using Git
- Pull Request (PR): reviewing and merging changes safely

In this assignment, we use GitHub branches, commits, and pull requests as part of a DevOps workflow.
GitHub Actions is used for CI checks in the repository.
